# Krish_chat

A chatbot built using React + Vite.

This project uses Vite for lightning-fast development and React for building UI components.

## Features

- Fast Refresh with Vite
- Minimal ESLint setup
- Ready for deployment on Vercel

## Development Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

## Recommended Next Steps

For production apps, consider using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for more info.
